# EJS ToDo List

Experimenting with Embedded JavaScript Templating (EJS) and Making a ToDo List with EJS

## Description:

In this project, provided by The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp, taught by Angela Yu, I learned about EJS and made an application where we Created a ToDo List.

## Topics Covered within This Project:

1. I learned that EJS is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript

2. The Express.JS ".render" Function is used to render a view and sends the rendered HTML string to the client.

3. How to run code inside the EJS Template

4. How to utilize EJS Tags within the EJS Files

5. About passing data from the webpage to the server

6. Learned about and how to utilize the "Date" Object to collect and display the day of the week, date, month, day, year, and time 

7. How to utilize the "toLocaleDateString" Method, which allows you to format your JavaScript using whichever format you wish

8. How to add Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to EJS by utilizing a folder titled, "Public", which serves as a Static Resource for the browser to run

9. I learned the difference between Templating VS Layouts. EJS provides the ability to create a Layout, which in my case was the header and the footer, and allows you to add a one-liner to your main files to create dryer code and reduces the probability of bugs or inconsistencies

10. Lastly, I learned about Node Modules and Exporting Files within Functions to other files. An Example of this can be seen in the App.JS File and the Date.JS Files

## How I Did and my Final Thoughts:

Overall I think I did well and learned a fair amount about how to utilize EJS. I have a better understanding of how to write APIs and how an API works.

This was a great project to show the capabilities of EJS and how to utilize Node.JS, and Express with EJS. While I found this project increased in complexity in comparison to what I previously have learned and coded, I find myself enjoying the backend more than I originally thought. That said, as always, I am excited to see and build what is next. Until next time... üëçüèº
